## Project II - convolutional neural networks

Image classification with convolutional neural networks


Dataset: CIFAR-10

you can utilize code from external sources (books, articles, blogs) provided that: 

• reference is cited in the report

• some modifications to the original solution are applied

violation of the above or any other kind of plagiarism result in a failing grade

application of pre-trained models (AlexNet, VGG, etc.) is permitted (and even

recommended as a part of the experiment)

crucial elements taken into account while assessment:

• report quality
• achieved accuracy registered on Kaggle
• the originality of the solution




• to obtain statistically significant results, each experiment should be repeated multiple times.

Assessment: source code, report





Useful resources:

Google Colab or GPU to speed up training

ensembling (soft voting or majority/hard voting)
